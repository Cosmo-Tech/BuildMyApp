# CoAL

Accelerate your solution development with the CosmoTech Acceleration Library (CoAL).

## Overview

The CosmoTech Acceleration Library (CoAL) is a Python library that provides pre-built functions and CLI tools to accelerate solution development. It offers standardized interfaces for common operations like data handling, API interactions, and external service integrations.

## What is CoAL?

CoAL provides four main components:
- **Core Library**: Base functionality and utilities
- **CSM Data CLI**: Command-line interface for data operations
- **Orchestrator Plugins**: Templates and extensions for CSM-ORC
- **Translation**: Internationalization support

## CSM Data CLI

### Available Commands
The `csm-data` CLI provides commands for common operations:
- **API Operations**: Interact with CosmoTech APIs
- **Data Management**: Handle datasets and files
- **Storage Operations**: Work with Azure, AWS, and other storage
- **Database Operations**: PostgreSQL, ADX, SQLite operations

*[Placeholder: List of main csm data commands]*

### Command Groups
Based on the meetings, key command groups include:
- **adx**: Azure Data Explorer operations
- **azure-storage**: Azure Blob Storage operations
- **s3**: AWS S3 operations (used for Dell ECS integration)
- **postgresql**: Database operations
- **API commands**: Direct platform API interactions

## Data Store

### SQLite Integration
CoAL provides a local SQLite database for:
- **Temporary Data Storage**: Keep data between run template steps
- **Data Processing**: SQL-based data manipulation
- **Performance**: Fast local access vs. repeated file operations
- **Export**: Dump to various target systems

*[Placeholder: Example of data store usage in run template]*

### Common Data Store Operations
1. **Import**: Load CSV, JSON, database tables into SQLite
2. **Transform**: Use SQL for data transformations
3. **Export**: Output to PostgreSQL, ADX, files, etc.
4. **Query**: Interactive SQL queries during development

## Integration with Run Templates

### Using CoAL Commands
Replace complex custom code with standardized commands:
- Use `csm data run-load-data` instead of custom data fetching
- Use data store commands for intermediate processing
- Use export commands for final data output

### Template Acceleration
CoAL templates provide shortcuts for common operations:
- **fetch-data**: Standard data download template
- **send-to-adx**: Export results to Azure Data Explorer
- **validate-data**: Common validation patterns

## Cloud Service Integration

### Azure Services
- **Blob Storage**: File storage and retrieval
- **Data Explorer (ADX)**: Analytics database operations
- **Functions**: Integration capabilities

### AWS Services
- **S3**: Object storage (including ECS compatibility for Dell)
- **Authentication**: IAM and credential management

### API Integration
- **CosmoTech API**: Simplified platform API access
- **Authentication**: Automatic token management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and retry logic

## Development Workflow

### Fast CLI Loading
CoAL uses lazy loading:
- CLI loads quickly by importing modules only when needed
- Individual commands load their dependencies at runtime
- Improves responsiveness for frequent CLI usage

### Local Development
- Test CoAL operations locally with same environment as production
- Use data store for iterative development
- Validate with real data before deployment

## Library Organization

CoAL is organized into functional modules:
- **AWS**: Amazon service integrations (S3)
- **Azure**: Azure service integrations (ADX, Blob, Functions)
- **CosmoTech API**: Platform API wrappers
- **Data Store**: SQLite database operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Database connectivity
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Use data store for intermediate processing instead of files
- Leverage SQL for data transformations
- Use batch operations for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Code Organization
- Use CoAL commands instead of custom implementations
- Standardize on CoAL patterns across projects
- Document any custom extensions
- Keep custom code minimal

### Error Handling
- Leverage CoAL's built-in error handling
- Use proper logging for debugging
- Implement appropriate retry logic
- Handle network timeouts gracefully

## Migration from Custom Code

When adopting CoAL:
1. **Identify Patterns**: Find operations that match CoAL capabilities
2. **Replace Gradually**: Migrate one operation at a time
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure equivalent functionality
4. **Update Documentation**: Document CoAL usage patterns

## Platform Evolution

CoAL evolves with the platform:
- **API Changes**: CoAL adapts to new API versions
- **New Services**: New integrations added over time
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility across versions
