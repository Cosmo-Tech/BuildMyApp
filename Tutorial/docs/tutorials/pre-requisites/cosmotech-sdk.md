# Cosmotech SDK

## Installation 

As this is the main tool of the Cosmo Tech IP, the installation guide won't be made public here, you can follow the references for the full installation information.

But the main elements are :

- Install the dependencies
- Download the installer
- Run the installer

## Update

The installer does not allow for inplace updates, to make version change of your installation you will have to uninstall the current version and follow the installation process anew for the version you want.
