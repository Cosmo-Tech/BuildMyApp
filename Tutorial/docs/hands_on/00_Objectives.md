# Objectives of the Build My App Hands On

During this Hands On we hope to get you to go through a comprehensive set of objectives that will transform you from a beginner to a proficient Solution Integration Expert.

## Quick Objectives Overview

- **End-to-End Deployment**: Go from a Simulator to a working deployed Solution in a single day
- **Complete Development Environment**: Every participant should end with a fully working environment to work on Solutions
- **Technical Mastery**: Get every participant to have global knowledge on tools and technologies required for Solutions (CoSML, Azure, Power BI, CosmoTech APIs, React, Docker, etc.)
- **Platform Understanding**: Offer an insight on how the different components of the Solutions and Platform work together
- **Documentation Navigation**: Give every participant the means to find their way through all documentations when they need in-depth answers
- **Team Collaboration**: Make participants work as a team throughout the learning process
- **Practical Skills**: Deploy and configure the complete brewery solution with all components (simulator, web app, Power BI dashboards, ADX database)
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Build confidence to independently develop and deploy new solutions
